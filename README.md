# welcome-world

A step above "Hello World," a collection of small functionally equivalent programs across multiple languages.

Over time, more will be added to the common specification, and more language projects will also be included.

## Specification

### Version 0

Print a "hello" message to the console. (This is implied only and new projects will start at version 1.)

### Version 1

Get user input from the console and display the value back in a message that uses some sort of string formatting.
